#Article Summarizer

This is a website that uses the GPT 4 model from OpenAI to summarize articles. Enter the URL of an article, and the website will generate a concise and informative summary of the article. The summary will be developed in real-time, so you can see it as soon as you submit the article URL.

The website is open source, so you can modify it to fit your own needs. For example, you could add a feature that allows users to specify the length of the summary, or the level of detail.

#Features

#Installation

To install the website, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed. Once you have those installed, you can clone the repository and run the following command:

This will start the website on your local machine. You can then access the website at http://localhost:3000.

#Usage

To use the website, simply enter the URL of an article in the input field and click the "Summarize" button. The website will then generate a summary of the article and display it in the output field.
